# Pitchfork
Natural Language Processing Project done together with my teammates Ramya Pandurangan and Ema Oyeyiola at the University of Iowa as part of the Text Analytics class project. In this project we:
• Used Python (Beautiful Soup, Requests) to scrape 4800 articles from the popular music publication website
• Manipulated and converted the output to a CSV file in order to filter it
• Performed Sentiment (NLTK, TextBlob) and Cluster&Topic (LDA modeling) analysis
